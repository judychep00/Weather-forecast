üåßÔ∏è Rain Forecasting Project ‚Äì Zindi Challenge
This repository contains my submission for a Zindi competition focused on predicting rainfall using a variety of meteorological and environmental features. The goal was to build a robust machine learning model capable of forecasting rain patterns with high accuracy, while also exploring the data through visual analytics.
üìä Project Overview
Rain prediction is a critical task in climate-sensitive regions, and this project aimed to leverage machine learning to forecast rainfall based on historical data. The dataset included multiple features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant indicators.


Key Steps & Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted thorough data cleaning and feature inspection.
Identified patterns, correlations, and anomalies using Python-based visualizations.

Model Development:
Trained several machine learning models including decision trees and ensemble methods.
Faced overfitting during initial training phases, especially with complex models.

Hyperparameter Tuning:
Applied grid search and randomized search techniques to optimize model parameters.
Achieved improved generalization and reduced overfitting.
 
Prediction: 
Final model used to generate rainfall predictions on unseen test data.
Performance evaluated using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, accuracy, etc.).

 Power BI Analysis: 
 Exported model outputs and key features to Power BI.
 Created interactive dashboards to visualize rainfall trends, feature importance, and prediction outcomes.
